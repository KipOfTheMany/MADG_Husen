# MADG_Husen
My Semesterworth of code

[Assignment 1](https://github.com/KipOfTheMany/MADG_Husen/blob/gh-pages/f17magd150lab01_Husen/f17magd150lab01_Husen.pde)

The first assignment of the year in which I took advanatge of the monochrome requirement and made a city at night.

[Assignment 3](https://github.com/KipOfTheMany/MADG_Husen/tree/gh-pages/f17magd150lab03_Husen)

I attemted to make a screen saver esk gradient before knowing how to animate, so the gradient is greated by the user moving the mouse.

[Assignment 5](https://github.com/KipOfTheMany/MADG_Husen/tree/gh-pages/f17magd150lab05_Husen)

I created a T.V out of simple shapes with code to create staic out of circles that I'm particularly proud of. The button code to "turn on" the T.V is a little glitchy.

[Assignment 7](https://github.com/KipOfTheMany/MADG_Husen/tree/gh-pages/f17magd150lab07_Husen)

Balloons. Ballons are fun when you have free reign to expand on a carnival theme. 

[Assignment 10](https://github.com/KipOfTheMany/MADG_Husen/tree/gh-pages/f17magd150lab10_HusenDevine)

A very abstract 3D design. I didn't perfectly tile the texture that was applied to the mesh, but I was short on time.
